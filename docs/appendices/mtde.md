# Minimum Technical Data Elements (MTDE)

&nbsp;
To facilitate cross analysis and improve the usability of the Gen3 commons, all data contributors should submit what are considered the “Minimum Technical Data Elements”.   These pre-analytic fields were determined through an iterative series of conversations with data contributors and the “Data Experience” Gen3 group.
