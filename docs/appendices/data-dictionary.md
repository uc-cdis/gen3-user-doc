## Data Dictionary Viewer
* * *

* The Data Dictionary Viewer is designed to make it easier to understand the data model, the field types associated with each node, and the potential values associated with each field. It helps you understand the available fields in a node and review the dependencies a given node has to the existence of a prior node.  This is an invaluable tool for both the submission of data and later analysis of the entire commons.   


* In addition to drilling down on the properties of each node, the Data Dictionary Viewer will also let you toggle views and browse the nodes as a graph and as tables.
